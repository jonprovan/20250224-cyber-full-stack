    <!--
        INLINE vs. BLOCK
        - an inline tag does NOT go to a new "line" on the page (e.g., italics) and takes up only the space that it takes up
        - a block tag forces itself onto a new line and takes up the full width

        NON-SEMANTIC vs. SEMANTIC
        non-semantic tags include span (inline) and div (block)
        these describe a generic line or block of content

        but there are other tags more specific to particular content
        we can use these to inform the user/browser what's contained in a tag
        and, in some cases, provide additional default formatting

        Semantic inline tags with formatting:
        em (emphasis), used to be i (italics)
        strong, used to be b (bold)
        img (images)
        some form input tags, like button, input, etc.
        a (anchor) for links

        Semantic block tags with formatting:
        h1-h6 for headings
        p (paragraph)
        ol (ordered list) and ul (unordered list)
        table

        Semantic block tags WITHOUT formatting (function exactly like div does):
        main
        section
        article
        header
        footer
        nav
        aside

        Some others:
        br (break) -- send the next content to a new line
        hr (horizontal rule) -- a line across the page
    -->

    <!-- span has no formatting, but strong does -->
    <span>Some Span Text</span>
    <strong>Some Strong Text</strong>

    <!-- neither div nor main have formatting -->
    <div>Some Div Text</div>
    <main>Some Main Text</main>

    <!-- ...but p does (spacing) -->
    <p>Some Paragraph Text</p>

    <!-- and ul does (spacing, indentation, bullets) -->
    <ul>
        <li>One</li>
        <li>Two</li>
        <li>Three</li>
    </ul>
